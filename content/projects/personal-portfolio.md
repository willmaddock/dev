Launched on **August 14, 2025**, this isn't just any project‚Äîit's the one you're reading right now! As a backend engineer with a flair for full-stack fun, I created this Hugo-based portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and certifications in a clean, responsive way. Using the PaperMod theme, it's deployed on GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions for seamless updates. Think of it as a meta masterpiece: a site that documents my work while demonstrating web dev prowess.

### üì¶ My Role: Creator, Designer, and Chief Fun Officer

- **Vision and Leadership**: Dreamed up a site that's professional yet playful, blending tech showcase with a touch of humor (e.g., documenting the site within itself!).
- **Development**: Configured Hugo from scratch, integrated PaperMod theme, and customized layouts for sections like Projects and Education.
- **Deployment**: Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD, handling submodules (like PaperMod) and static generation.
- **Content Creation**: Wrote Markdown for all pages, embedded images/PDFs, and optimized for SEO and search.
- **Fun Factor**: Added Easter eggs like this meta project page‚Äîbecause why not make portfolios entertaining?

This project leveled up my skills in **static site generation**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **creative web design**.
