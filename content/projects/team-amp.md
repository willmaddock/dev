From **August 2024 to December 2024**, I served as **Technical Lead** for the **Auraria Mobile Parking (AMP) project**, a Kotlin-based mobile app developed for MSU Denver‚Äôs CS4360 senior course as part of my B.S. in Computer Science. AMP streamlines parking for students, staff, faculty, and visitors, reducing stress during busy campus hours.
